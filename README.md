# Chip-8

**Chip-8** is my personal project aimed at building a CHIP-8 emulator using the C programming language. As an aspiring developer eager to delve into the world of emulation, I chose to start with CHIP-8 due to its simplicity and suitability as a learning tool.

## Introduction

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language used on vintage computers like the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800. Its straightforward instruction set makes it an ideal starting point for emulator development.

## Features

- **CHIP-8 Emulation:** Blondechip-8 faithfully replicates the behavior of a CHIP-8 interpreter, enabling users to run classic CHIP-8 games and programs.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Being written in C, Chip-8 is platform-independent, ensuring that it can run seamlessly on various operating systems.
